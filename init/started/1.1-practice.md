# 1.1 Practice

I do not think you need to spend your time on environment setting up for now. The enviroment setting up will be covered in the future session.

Run the code below \(Click the Run Button\), that will be your first python program.

* `main.py` is the python file which stored your codes
* the bottom part\(or right part\) is a Python REPL shell, feel free to play around it too, it must be in a container, you won't ruin it.
